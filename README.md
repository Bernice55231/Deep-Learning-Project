# Deep-Learning-Project

## Context and Goal:
Adversarial Attacks now is an increasing threat in the AI and machine learning community. And Evasion attacks, which are the most prevalent type of attack, can inserts a small perturbation into the input of a model to make it classify incorrectly.  In addition, it is difficult for developers to improve model in real-time. Therefore, ML researchers are looking for some ways that can make model robust against attacking. 
Inspired by high performance and efficiency that transfer learning model achieved, we are encouraged to apply this method into the mobilenetv2, which is an effective model that pushes the state of the art for mobile visual recognition including classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. We would like to fine tune this model to see whether it can hold the performance under evasion attacks. 

## Approach:
### Get base model of our target dataset:
